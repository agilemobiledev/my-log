h3. Motivation

Having gotten used to Nokia UI's, my first instinct when calling someone was to "push the green button", and then select the contact or phone number from the list. 

The call log in my Nexus One didn't really fill that requirement since it took 2 clicks to get there and it was an actual _log_ of each call.

And I wanted to see if it was easy to write for Android using "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/
It was.
